# Prodigy_DS_4
I have successfully concluded my fourth and final task as a Data Science intern at Prodigy Infotech. The project centered on Twitter sentiment analysis utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP). I utilized the recommended dataset from Kaggle, conducting exploratory data analysis and employing data visualization techniques based on tweet content and sentiment. Subsequently, I performed data cleaning using NLTK to remove stop words, quotes, and other semi-structured data, transforming the data into a list of keywords derived from the tweet content feature. The processed data was then utilized to train a machine learning model. Both k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest models exhibited promising results, with Random Forest being my preferred choice. The selected model achieved a commendable accuracy of 87%
